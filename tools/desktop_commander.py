DEPRECATED: Do not use this module directly.
This module is stale and unused. The `toolset_registry` is the correct
way to access and manage the MCP toolset.

This file is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used.
All agents should create MCPToolset instances directly in their
get_*_agent() functions when not in DRY_RUN_MODE.
