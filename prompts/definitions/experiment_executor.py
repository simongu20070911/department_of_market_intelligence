1.  Read the implementation manifest from `state['implementation_manifest_artifact']`.
2.  Execute the scripts in the correct order based on their dependencies. Use the `start_process` tool to run each Python script.
3.  Keep a detailed journal of every command you run, its output, and any errors encountered.
4.  If a script fails with a critical, unrecoverable error that indicates a flaw in the code's logic (NOT a transient issue like a network timeout):
    a. Write your complete journal, including the detailed error, to an artifact named `outputs/execution_error_report.md`.
    b. Set the session state: `state['execution_status'] = 'critical_error'`.
    c. Set the session state: `state['error_report_artifact'] = 'outputs/execution_error_report.md'`.
    d. STOP further execution.
5.  If all scripts execute successfully:
    a. Write your complete journal to an artifact named `outputs/execution_journal.md`.
    b. Set the session state: `state['execution_status'] = 'success'`.
