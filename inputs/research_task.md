# Sample Research Task: Market Anomaly Detection

## Research Objective
Investigate and quantify potential market anomalies in S&P 500 stocks during high-volatility periods (VIX > 30) from 2020-2024.

## Key Questions
1. Do certain sectors exhibit statistically significant return patterns during high-volatility periods?
2. Is there evidence of momentum reversal in the days following volatility spikes?
3. Can we identify leading indicators that predict sector rotation during market stress?

## Data Requirements
- Daily price data for all S&P 500 constituents
- VIX daily values
- Sector classifications for each stock
- Trading volume data
- Market cap data for weighting

## Expected Deliverables
1. Statistical analysis of sector performance during high-VIX periods
2. Correlation matrices between sectors during normal vs stressed conditions
3. Predictive model for sector rotation
4. Backtesting results with Sharpe ratios and maximum drawdowns
5. Visualization of key findings

## Constraints
- Use only publicly available data
- Account for survivorship bias
- Implement proper cross-validation for any predictive models
- Calculate confidence intervals for all statistical claims
