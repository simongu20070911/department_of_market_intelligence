# Junior Validator Critique v0

### Critical Issues Identified

1.  **Lookahead Bias in Analysis Period:**
    *   **Issue:** The plan specifies an analysis period ending December 31, 2024, which is in the future.
    *   **Why Critical:** This assumes access to data that does not yet exist, violating the fundamental principle of point-in-time analysis. All results derived from this assumption would be invalid.

2.  **Backtest Ignores Transaction Costs:**
    *   **Issue:** The backtesting plan (5.1.1) for the long-short sector strategy does not mention accounting for transaction costs such as commissions, slippage, or bid-ask spreads.
    *   **Why Critical:** A strategy that rebalances daily will incur significant trading costs. Ignoring them will lead to a drastic overestimation of performance (Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Return), making an unprofitable strategy appear profitable.

3.  **Static Market Regime Definition:**
    *   **Issue:** The plan defines a high-volatility regime using a fixed threshold of VIX > 30 for the entire 2020-2024 period.
    *   **Why Critical:** The market's perception of "high" volatility can change. A VIX of 30 might be a panic in one year but less severe in another. This makes the findings highly sensitive to an arbitrary threshold and not robust across different market contexts.

4.  **Questionable Statistical Test Assumptions:**
    *   **Issue:** The plan relies on Welch's and paired t-tests (3.1.2, 3.2.2), which assume normally distributed, stationary data.
    *   **Why Critical:** Financial returns are well-documented to be non-normal (fat-tailed) and non-stationary. Applying tests without validating these assumptions can produce spurious statistical significance, leading to false conclusions about sector performance and momentum reversals.

5.  **Potential for Insufficient Sample Size:**
    *   **Issue:** The number of days where VIX > 30 might be small. The plan does not include a step to verify if the "stressed" period has a large enough sample size for the proposed t-tests or for training a reliable Random Forest model.
    *   **Why Critical:** A small sample size can lead to statistically insignificant results or a model that overfits to a few specific crisis events, lacking any true predictive power.
