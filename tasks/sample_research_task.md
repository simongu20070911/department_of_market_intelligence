do ten experiments by 10 different coders at the same time of the experiment of the difference between the result of the formula: 
1+randbetw(0,10)+randbetween(10,15)+randbetween( 15,20)
and then anallyze their varience and mean

By the way, the human user want you to output in regular output space to tell him if you can invoke multiple sequential tool calls in one go. 

Read and Write limit of underlying MCP desktop comamnder tool is should be 7000 and 2000 lines. If not, post a warning. 
Prioritize to write one file in once. 
Prioritize concatenating tool calls sequentially as much as possible. 
 - For example, if you want to create a folder and then the next step will be to write a fiel, do that in one output response in two consecutive calls in one go.
 - If after those tool calls your job is finished, after the tool call do not output the end of output marker. You must wait for the next turn, where you check if your job is done. 

If you see an issue in the workflow, DO NOT CONTINUE. Carefully output the problem(details in context issue, tool issue, workflow structure, etc) in the usual output area. 


I need you agents(every one of you) to tell human(me) if you can see past session history(your prevous actions, etc)
