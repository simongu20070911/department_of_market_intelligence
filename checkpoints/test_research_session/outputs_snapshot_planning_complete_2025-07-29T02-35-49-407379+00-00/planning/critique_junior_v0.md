# Junior Validator Critique - test_research_session

## Review Summary
[DRY RUN] The research plan shows solid foundation but could benefit from enhancements:

### Strengths Identified
✅ Clear research objectives and scope
✅ Appropriate statistical methodology outlined
✅ Reasonable timeline and resource allocation
✅ Relevant data sources identified

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Statistical Rigor
- **Recommendation**: Add power analysis for sample size justification
- **Details**: Current plan lacks statistical power calculations for detecting meaningful effect sizes
- **Impact**: May lead to underpowered studies or inflated sample sizes

#### 2. Data Quality Controls
- **Recommendation**: Expand data cleaning and validation procedures
- **Details**: Include outlier detection methods, missing data imputation strategies
- **Impact**: Ensures robust findings and reproducible results

#### 3. Risk Mitigation
- **Recommendation**: Add contingency plans for data availability issues
- **Details**: Specify alternative data sources and fallback methodologies
- **Impact**: Prevents project delays due to unforeseen data constraints

#### 4. Regulatory Context
- **Recommendation**: Include recent regulatory changes in analysis framework
- **Details**: Account for rule changes that may confound time series analysis
- **Impact**: Improves causal interpretation of findings

## Overall Assessment
The plan demonstrates strong research fundamentals but requires methodological refinements before proceeding to implementation.

**Status**: Requires revision
**Priority**: Medium - addressable with focused improvements
